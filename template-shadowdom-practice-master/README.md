# Web Components: Template & (some) Shadow DOM Practice

This is some really simple Web Components code I hacked together, just so I could better understand how WC works. It mainly focuses on templates but also uses a little Shadow DOM.

The code is documented in both [`index.html`](https://github.com/kaidez/template-shadowdom-practice/blob/master/index.html) and [`scripts/main.js`](https://github.com/kaidez/template-shadowdom-practice/blob/master/scripts/main.js), so you MIGHT have a enough info to start using the code right now. But for an in-depth look at the code, view the related blog post [here](http://kaidez.com/web-components-demo/).
